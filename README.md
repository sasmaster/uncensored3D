# uncensored3D

This is the place of my experiments with EMSCRIPTEN, OpenGL ES3.0, WebGL2.0 ,
GPU Path rendering, and other stuff, which I find appropriate for public eyes.

Also, I am going to write it all in C.

Anyone is free to copy - paste and use for whatever needs. Beware, this code is in very
raw state, hence it is far from being suitable for any commercial use at the moment.

Application dependencies:

### GLES3.0 emulator 
Used to run GLES2,3 APIs on desktop.
Can be downloaded from IMAGINATION technologies:
https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK

### GLFW3.x 
Used to create display and GL context.

### Math library 
linmath.h  C header only math library:
https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h

### Image loading library 
Stb image.Header only collection of libs:
https://github.com/nothings/stb


The application uses Visual Studio 2015 community edition.
